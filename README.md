# Betaflight Configurator

Ok... this needs a new name "Configurator" isn't even a word. I propose the name "Betaflight ToolBox."

## Authors

Betaflight Configurator was originally a [fork](#credits) of the CleanFlight Configurator which was a BaseFlight configurator fork with support for Betaflight instead of Baseflight.
